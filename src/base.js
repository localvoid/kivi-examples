 * by specifying --define goog.DEBUG=false to the JSCompiler. For example, most

/**
 * Handles strings that are intended to be used as CSS class names.
 *
 * This function works in tandem with @see goog.setCssNameMapping.
 *
 * Without any mapping set, the arguments are simple joined with a hyphen and
 * passed through unaltered.
 *
 * When there is a mapping, there are two possible styles in which these
 * mappings are used. In the BY_PART style, each part (i.e. in between hyphens)
 * of the passed in css name is rewritten according to the map. In the BY_WHOLE
 * style, the full css name is looked up in the map directly. If a rewrite is
 * not specified by the map, the compiler will output a warning.
 *
 * When the mapping is passed to the compiler, it will replace calls to
 * goog.getCssName with the strings from the mapping, e.g.
 *     var x = goog.getCssName('foo');
 *     var y = goog.getCssName(this.baseClass, 'active');
 *  becomes:
 *     var x= 'foo';
 *     var y = this.baseClass + '-active';
 *
 * If one argument is passed it will be processed, if two are passed only the
 * modifier will be processed, as it is assumed the first argument was generated
 * as a result of calling goog.getCssName.
 *
 * @param {string} className The class name.
 * @param {string=} opt_modifier A modifier to be appended to the class name.
 * @return {string} The class name or the concatenation of the class name and
 *     the modifier.
